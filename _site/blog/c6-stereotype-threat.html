                You don't need to love science to appreciate it, but I love it anyway. Not just the cold and calculating hard sciences that help us to land on Mars, but
                also the social sciences that extend their intuition into the human condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stereotype threat is one of those ideas that sound like superstition until you read the experiments. After that it appears obvious. But the investigators
                just kept looking for more answers. They dug until they found a gem of a theory that could apply to anyone. And the mechanisms appear reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stereotype threat is the pressure that comes from a person's fear of confirming a negative stereotype related to their identity. It's real to us because we
                know negative attitudes are real. Once you have been placed in a box it's hard to get out.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't discuss the details of the experiments, but they are convincing. When the experiments were setup to subtly remind the participants of stereotypes
                about a group they are in, their performance suffered. It was consistent across several demographics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best part of the theory was the explanation. Our working memory is limited. Any energy we expend on anxiety and recalling negative events takes away
                from our ability to solve problems. This knowledge offers me a small degree of freedom. We may be able to overcome some of the drawbacks with relaxation
                and focus. It isn't a complete solution, but it is a pathway forward.
