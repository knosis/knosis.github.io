                 A shared learning experience is not always one where people feel free to share. It often begins with anxiety, followed by a realization of the other person's skill level. Emotions after that depend on the combined level of emotional intelligence between the two partners. I've partnered with people who were quite helpful when I didn't understand certain concepts. I've also partnered with people who were looking for someone better than themselves and made it obvious that they were committed to completing the task more than building rapport.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The one thing that has been pleasantly surprising and reassuring is the level of anxiety I've found in some of of the paired programming sessions. It must come from a fear of struggling in front of another person. Similar to how a person might feel performing in front of a group, or in front of an expert. The razor edge of judgment is always a threat. Criticism is usually as sharp as their mind and as soft as their heart.</p>
                <p>However, some of the best feedback I've had was constructive and specific. It was sharp, but it wasn't meant to cut. It was more like tweezers than a scalpel. It located a unseen issue and helped me remove it.
