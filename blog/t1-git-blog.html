      You get extra points for curiosity. Not too many people would read an obscure blog about an obscure topic. You're going to go far in life. This is an explanantion of version control, which is popular term in coding circles, but means nothing to regular folks.

        We'll start with a simple premise. Coding is very much like writing. However some programs have a million lines of code. That's a lot for one person to do. Version control was created so that many coders could work on different parts of the same project without interfering with each others work. Version control helps them organize their work so they can prevent or resolve conflicts.

        Github helps you keep track of changes giving you a way to document your updates and double check changes before you put them together. Collaborators can see your changes and previous versions of your work. If they would like to collaborate they can see your progress and begin.

        You can also use Github to store code. This is useful when you have multiple people working on the same codebase. Github is on the web, so anyone with internet access can contribute. This makes it much easier to have collaborators from all over the country or even the world.
