                    <p>It's important to stay organized when you are designing
                      coding a website. As you continue to gain more experience
                      begin to understand ways to work more efficiently. It's
                      possible to code a web page in many different ways, but
                      it isn't always easy to look back at that markup later
                      and make changes easily. One of the ways to make things
                      easy on yourself in the future is to get a better
                      understanding of the elements you use and how to best use
                      them.</p>

                    <p>CSS classes and IDs are never seen by the user, but they
                      effect changes throughout the website. One smart principle
                      of coding is to "don't repeat yourself", otherwise known as
                      dry. This applies to CSS. Instead of adding the same color
                      or styling to every individual element, you can add a class
                      to those elements and give them all the same style. This
                      would save you a lot of work and that is the point. It's
                      easy to repeat yourself on when you are designing. As you
                      get more experience, you can make more shortcuts.</p>

                      <p>Don't repeat yourself applies to IDs as well. Never repeat
                        them. They are for unique elements on the page. If your logo
                        shared classes with other images, it might end up with
                        styling you don't want. Your logo is one of a kind on the
                        web page so treat it that way. Give other special elements
                        the same treatment and style them individually if they need it.</p>
