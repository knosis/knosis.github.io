                 Some methods are more important than others. If you are interested in learning to Ruby you should know more about the Enumerable method. Programming gives you great power. One of those powers is the ability to manipulate large numbers (even millions) of objects. This includes, files, status updates, user accounts, websites and the like.You would interact with those large collections of objects with a method similar or related to Enumerable. It keeps count of objects in your collection and organizes them when you need to perform operations on them.

                  One of my favorite methods is map. Its similar to each. It's an iterator, except it also performs operations and returns the new value. This is important in large in many different languages. You should play around with it a little and see how it differs from other iterator methods.</p>
