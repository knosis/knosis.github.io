     The cohort and Google+ are a tremendous support group which helps a lot when you are taking on a new adventure. This is exactly the kind of environment I hoped. People are nervous but they seem to be working through their anxiety. Once we have moved the phase 1, we will really see how the group will come together.

       I am not nervous, but that does not mean I do not anticipate difficulty. My current job has a very hectic busy season and I've learned that anxiety doesn't help. Planning and working through issues is the best solution. Progress is one of the best anxiety relievers for me.</p>
    <p>I've learned that asking for help is effective. People in this cohort are quick to respond.
